# downsha-note-win
This is an implementation of web note client for Windows platform. It is similar as Evernote or OneNote. We use VC++ 2012 as our main IDE and compiler. We also use some excellent open-source projects as our components. We use HTMLayout as our Windows UI renderer, CEF as our web note renderer,  SQLite as our local note database.
